## Week 1.2

### Notes:

- Improve on varaible naming
- Refer to the question to see if variables were given and stick to it
- Always ask yourself, what will happen to your function if the parameter you are expecting is not what is provided to the function.
  `Read more on Error handling`
- Also check and improve on your consistence naming patterns
  That is

```js
function isAdult()
function filterByAge()
function Sum()
```

It is clear that you started with `camelCasing` and you mixed it up with `Pascal`. Be consistent.

- There were duplicated function names
  `double()` and `double()`
- The `compose` function seems not do what it was meant for.
