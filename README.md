## Week 1.3

### Notes:

- Make sure you understand what is going on in the JS file, that all the DOM manipulation are well understood
- You are also supposed to remove event listeners or clear them when you add them.
  This is done after the event listener is activated or used.
  So within the function that triggers the event lister, you can remove the event before the function ends.
- One element was left out. What happens when the date of the todo is due?
